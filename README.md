# Ticket System Demo (Case Study)

Full Stack demo project using **Node.js**, **Angular**, **Supabase**, **PDFKit**, and **JWT authentication**.

This project is a simplified version of a real system developed during my professional internship.

It demonstrates how to manage client information, equipment entries, service tickets, and automatic PDF generation for reports — using modern full-stack technologies.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The goal of this system is to organize and simplify the process of equipment reception, service tracking, and delivery reports.

This demo is **not the company’s original code** — it’s a recreated version based on my personal contributions and architecture experience.

## 💡 My Contributions

I contributed to both the backend and frontend sides of the project,  
focusing on data integrity, usability, and automated report generation.

During the original project:
- Designed and structured the **database schema** and all **table relationships**.  
- Implemented **CRUD operations** in Node.js using **Sequelize** and **Supabase**.  
- Developed the **PDF generation module** for equipment service receipts using **PDFKit**.  
- Built and styled the **frontend modules** in Angular to display, search, and filter client data.  
- Integrated **JWT authentication** and middleware for secure access control.  
- Conducted testing and debugging to ensure stable integration between frontend and backend.
